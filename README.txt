To use the rotation controls, the device must have access to the ROTATION_VECTOR sensor, which needs an accelerometer and a magnetometer.
If the sensor used for the game is not present on the device, the touch controls will be used.

BrickyClimb is based on the famous game "BrickBreaker" but bricks have a number of lives and can be placed anywhere on the screen.
